# jlox

This is my implementation of jlox created while following Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters". In it's current state, the project has a working scanner and parser. The text is grouped into tokens which are further grouped together into expressions that are represented in the form of an Abstract Syntax tree.

Some explanation of the jargon above: the current workflow of the project is to take the source file, read it as a string and convert it to "tokens" (basically atttaching a meaning to groups of text: what type they are, value, etc.). The next step is to take the tokens and create "expressions" out of them. What that means is to take a series of tokens and attach some more meaning to them (grouping them together and defining what the tokens represent in a larger context). This is very similar to the previous step, we're just forming expressions out of sequence of tokens instead of tokens out of sequence of characters. It's a pattern, at every stage we add more and more data (defining what the code that was written by the user means in context of the rules of the language) to the simple text we had in the beginning to make it consumable for the interpreter. The way that we evaluate expressions is going to be through an Abstract Syntax Tree.

Update: The interpreter is now alive and has code for dealing with all the expression types. We pass it the expression, it constructs a syntax tree and executes(evaluates) it. It's kind of like a calculator right now but it will start looking good once we add statements, functions, variables and all the other good stuff
