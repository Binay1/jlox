# jlox

This is my tree-walk interpreter for the Lox programming language created while following Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters". In it's current state, the project has a working scanner, parser and interpreter with support for variables, if statements, for/while loops, functions, local scope in the form of block statements. Functions and classes come next. I'll try to write down all the basic syntax sometime soon, so people know how to write in Lox.

The current workflow of the project is to take the source file, read it as a string and convert it to "tokens" (basically atttaching a meaning to groups of text: what type they are, value, etc.). The next step is to take the tokens and create "expressions", "statements" out of them. What that means is to take a series of tokens and attach some more meaning to them (grouping them together and defining what the tokens represent in a larger context based on the language grammar that we have defined). This is very similar to the previous step, we're just forming expressions/statements out of sequence of tokens instead of tokens out of sequence of characters. In terms of heirarchy, statements come above expressions. Expressions are like a sub-class (not in the literal java sense) of statements. We have an "expression statement" that acts like a wrapper for all expressions. The Parser converts the text to a "syntax tree" made up of a few basic types of expression and statement nodes that we have defined and it's job ends. The interpreter class then takes the syntax-tree as input and then evaluates it. Before we send the syntax tree to the interpreter, we do a variable resolution pass through the tree once. It basically assigns each variable it's value at the end of parsing and does a few error checks (like no return statements outside functions) so that the interpreter doesn't encounter anything weird
